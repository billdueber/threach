# Monkey-patch Enumerable to allow threach (threaded-each)

module Enumerable
  # Provide an each-like iterator that uses the main thread to produce
  # work (generally via the underlying #each, but can use any method with
  # the optional arguments, e.g., each_with_index or each_line) and a
  # set of consumer threads to do the work specified in the passed block.
  #
  # Under the hood, threach populates a thread-safe queue with work from a
  # producer thread and uses the specified number of consumer threads to do the work.
  #
  # Note that threach is designed to be thread-safe internally, but the code you pass
  # in via the block also has to be thread-safe (e.g., if your database isn't
  # thread-safe, you can't be using it willy-nilly with three threads at a time). threach
  # is syntactic sugar only; it doens't magically make things thread-safe.
  #
  # NOTE: threach is just sugar over normal Thread operations. You can set thread-local variables
  # in the normal way -- by calling Thread.current[:var] = 'value'. If for some reason you want it, 
  # the thread number is stored in Thread.current[:tnum]. 
  #
  # @param [Integer] threads The number of consumer threads to spin up. A value of zero indicates that work should just be done serially
  # @param [Symbol] iterator The already-existing iterator to use to create work for the consumers. The output of the iterator is fed to the passed block, so if your chosen iterator produces two values (e.g.,  each_with_index) your block should, too (see below) 
  # @param [Block] &blk The block representing the conumer's work.
  #
  #
  # @example Use two threads to check URLs
  #   urls.threach(2) {|url|
  #     see_if_url_is_there(url)
  #   }
  #
  # @example Process lines of a file using three threads
  #   File.open('myfile') do |f|
  #     f.threach(3, :each_line) do |line|
  #       process_line(line)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Process items in a hash (to show two-valued items for consumption)
  #   myBigHash.threach(2, :each_with_index) do |k,v|
  #    puts "The value of #{k} is #{v}"
  #   end
